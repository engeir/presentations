## Motivation

### Plot AOD vs TOA

Gregory talks about AOD vs TOA. He asks if other models also have a cloud adjustment
as well as a lower climate sensitivity for volcanic forcing.

### Introduce linear model

Temperature anomaly equals forcing through a linear operator.

## Results

I have plots of:

- SO2, AOD, TOA, temp (CESM2)
- SO2, temp (CESM1)
- SO2, AOD, (TOA), temp (VolMIP, Pinatubo)

Either peaks or annual means, but annual means remove SO2.

What we see:

- Difference between high-top and low-top atmospheres, or perhaps more importantly
  between models with or without chemistry
- No linear relation between SO2 or AOD versus temperature
- But, temperature superpose, so maybe there is a linear relation between temperature
  and some function of either SO2 or AOD?

## Summary/links

The plans going forward are to fill out the plots with simulations done with WACCM6,
both an AOGCM and an AGCM. I.e., more magnitudes.
