## Abstract

We investigate how the global mean temperature responds to single volcanic events of
different magnitudes and to multiple events occurring close in time. We are using the
Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) to simulate the Earth system forced only
with stratospheric aerosols from explosive volcanoes, with the rest of the climate
system fixed at 1850 conditions.

Previous efforts of estimating a response function assume a linear relationship between
the forcing and the deterministic temperature response to the forcing [1], defined as
T^{det(t)}=L[F(t)]. Studies also show that the forcing is similar across forcing agents
[2] (although this is not a settled debate [3]), in which case volcanoes could provide a
valuable means of estimating global temperature response to radiative forcing due to
their short-lived and large temperature responses.

We present simulations of single volcano events with ejected sulphate aerosol loadings
differing in orders of magnitude and simulations where two volcanic eruptions are close
enough in time that the second eruption occurs as the temperature is still recovering
from the first event.

We show that the functional form of the temperature response is similar for volcanic
events of different magnitudes and that non-linearities are not important as a second
eruption occurs when the temperature is well below equilibrium in a perturbed state. The
results further suggest the global mean temperature time series may be reduced to a
simple superposition of individual pulses, and thus that it may be described by a
convolution between a linear response function and some forcing, analogous to the model
used by [1].
