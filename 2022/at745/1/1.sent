# Is it closely related to other models?
Similar models include:
    NorESM (from CESM2.1)
        Differences: ocean model and aersosol
        module
    E3SM (from CESM1)
        Similarities: atm. model is based on
        CAM5, MOSART used in both

# TODO:
What equation set is used?
Is the atmosphere model quasi-static?

# Atmosphere discretization

# TODO:
How is the sphere discretized for the atmosphere and
for the ocean?
    CAM uses the cubed sphere, optinally a "continuous
        Galerkin spectral finite element method"
    In POP2, SH uses spherical coordinates and NH ...?

# TODO:
What horizontal grid spacings are typically used for
the atmosphere and for the ocean?
# Ocean
    Uses a B-grid
# Smith and Gent (2010)

# TODO:
What vertical coordinate is used for the
atmosphere and for the ocean?
# Atmosphere
    Quasi-Lagrangian, like the ùúÇ-coordinate, a hybrid
        ùúé-ùëù-coordinate, used elsewhere in CAM
    Discretized with a Lorenz staggering
    Finite volume (FV) dynamics are time-split

Does the atmosphere model include the stratosphere?
    Yes, CAM ends at 2.26 hPa (40 km), while WACCM ends
    at 4.5‚®Ø10‚Åª‚Å∂ hPa. Both include at least parts of the
    stratosphere
# Danabasoglu et al (2020)

How many layers are typically used with the
atmosphere and ocean models?
    CAM6 uses 32 layers, WACCM6 70 layers
    POP2 has 60 levels down to 5500 m, 10 m resolution
        down to 160, then it increases monotonically
        to 250 m at 3500 m

model, and the ocean model?
