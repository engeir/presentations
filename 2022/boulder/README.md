# Talk in Boulder CO

Talk should largely focus on WACCM and how and why I use it.

## Ideas

- What is the main goal/aim of the project
- Describe the model setup I use
- Explain steps I take when running the model, possibly a quick look at
  `volcano-cooking`
- Present results I showed on CHESS AM 22
- Present results from double-overlap simulation
- Discuss seasonal variability and ask for tips
- Possibly some future ideas/suggestions
